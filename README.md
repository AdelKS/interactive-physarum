## Interactive physarum

Interactive physarum/organic simulations, for an installation with gamepad control.

Please check out 36 Points by Sage Jenson first: https://www.sagejenson.com/36points/

It is implemented with openFrameworks and the simulations run on GPU with compute shaders.

Work derived from mxsage's 36 points (https://www.sagejenson.com/36points/) but with a different implementation.
Before studying mxsage's I already had a physarum implementation. I modified my implementation to use their technique.
I'm using atomic counters on pixels and this is different. I'm using the set of parameters from 36 Points. Some work well, some don't, I had to tune stuff.
This is also introducing interaction with gamepad.
